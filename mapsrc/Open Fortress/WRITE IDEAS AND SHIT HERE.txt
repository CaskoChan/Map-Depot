// NOTES \\

--- ok i really like the design/the way this is going so i think ill dedicate myself to this idea  --- yeah right
--- but this is essentially a weird/alternative version of dm_angeles so take inspiration of that ---

--- the event version will be worked on until the actual map is done ---

// IDEAS & BALANCING \\

--- verticality i guess, cant just be le flat suburbs that would be boring and bad i think --- yeah right
--- with that being said the theme is CALIFORNIA/METROPOLITAN/MODERN or something like that, when it comes to design and geometry think of like the early or late 80s/70s stuff and that neat vintage architecture from that period of time --- yeah right
--- the weapons around the ground level of the houses probably shouldnt be the automatic ones but rather explosives or semi automatic (like no tommygun, machine gun, burst rifle) --- yeah right
--- the railgun should be somewhere that ISNT in a sniper poach or somewhere that isnt elevated --- yeah right
