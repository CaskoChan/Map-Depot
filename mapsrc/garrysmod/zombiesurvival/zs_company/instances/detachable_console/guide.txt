[detachableconsole]

Description: These are the detachable consoles seen inside the Citadel when you get the supercharged Gravity Gun. These should only be used for personal Breencast's to the player inside the citadel, and should not be used for regular Breencast's around the city.

Configuration: Select the func_monitor entity and change the 'Camera name' parameter to 'camera_tv_consoleslate'. Select the env_microphone entity and change the 'Measure target' to 'target_breen_micsamplepoint' for Breencasts or 'info_kleinermic_samplepoint' for Kleinercasts. When the func_monitor entity is enabled or disabled, the 'combine_monitor_screenoverlay brush' in front of it should be toggled alongside with the monitor.

Extra info: These are detachable, however you will need the supercharged gravity gun to detach them.
